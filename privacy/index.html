  <h1>Analytics Data</h1>
  <p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my App, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information on your phone called Analytics Data.</p>
  <p>This Analytics Data may include information such as your device's model, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my App, the time and date of your use of the App, and other statistics.</p>

  <p>I value your trust in storing your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable,
    and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

  <p>This App does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete
    this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
